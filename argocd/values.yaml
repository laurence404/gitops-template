# We don't use the argo-cd subchart to create Ingress resources
# as we can't pass through the domain helm variable. Instead we
# create our own in templates/ingress.yaml
# Alternatively you could hardcode your domain as below:
#  server:
#    ingress:
#      enabled: true
#      extraHosts:
#        - name: argocd.local.yourdomain.com
#  global:
#    domain: argocd.yourdomain.com
